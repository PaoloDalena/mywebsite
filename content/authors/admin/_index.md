I was born in [Putignano](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8492187,17.1225482,3a,75y,70.92h,99.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slr2xdEuNgaCkx6MqLo2Ugg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) in 1997.  
{{< staticref "media/mar.jpeg" "newtab" >}}My mother{{< /staticref >}} is a proud high school teacher of Italian literature, while {{< staticref "media/adr.jpeg" "newtab" >}}my father{{< /staticref >}} is something in between a plumber and a gas operator.  From them I probably got my interest in textual analysis and my propensity for practicality and organization respectively.  
In 2016, after Scientific High School, I moved to [Bologna](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Piazza+Maggiore/@44.4938753,11.342443,3a,75y,134.83h,107.53t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipM2FBB6JfQXctdXTAcWCH_l48xfg67JPEGDinEQ!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipM2FBB6JfQXctdXTAcWCH_l48xfg67JPEGDinEQ%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-18.11897-ya55.94854-ro-0-fo100!7i10240!8i5120!4m7!3m6!1s0x477fd49586d65539:0x3ec4fc9a3ae6b51e!8m2!3d44.4937544!4d11.3430945!14m1!1BCgIgARICCAI) to attend the Bachelor of Science in Statistical Sciences at [Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/). In 2019 I graduated with a [thesis in Text Mining with R on complex text sources](https://paolodalena.github.io/bachelor_thesis_book/) and I subsequently enrolled in a Master of Science in Data science, also at the University of Bologna.  
I am currently collaborating (as a Data Scientist trainee) with the [Research Center of the Deutsche Bundesbank](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/research/research-centre) on a private project (regarding Text Mining).  
In April 2021 I will move to the [Hochschule Mannheim](https://www.english.hs-mannheim.de/the-university.html) as an Erasmus student to take part to a project in Computational Genomics, about which I will write my Master Thesis.
