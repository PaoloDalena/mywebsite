I was born in [Putignano](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8492187,17.1225482,3a,75y,70.92h,99.73t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slr2xdEuNgaCkx6MqLo2Ugg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) in 1997.  
{{< staticref "media/mar.jpeg" "newtab" >}}My mother{{< /staticref >}} is a proud high school teacher of Italian literature, while {{< staticref "media/adr.jpeg" "newtab" >}}my father{{< /staticref >}} is a retired specialist gas operator.  From them I probably got my interest in textual analysis and my propensity for practicality and organization respectively.  
In 2016, after Scientific High School, I moved to [Bologna](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Piazza+Maggiore/@44.4938753,11.342443,3a,75y,134.83h,107.53t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipM2FBB6JfQXctdXTAcWCH_l48xfg67JPEGDinEQ!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipM2FBB6JfQXctdXTAcWCH_l48xfg67JPEGDinEQ%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-18.11897-ya55.94854-ro-0-fo100!7i10240!8i5120!4m7!3m6!1s0x477fd49586d65539:0x3ec4fc9a3ae6b51e!8m2!3d44.4937544!4d11.3430945!14m1!1BCgIgARICCAI) to attend the Bachelor of Science in Statistical Sciences at [Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/). In 2019 I graduated with a [thesis in Text Mining with R on complex text sources](https://paolodalena.github.io/bachelor_thesis_book/) and I subsequently enrolled in a Master of Science in Data science, also at the University of Bologna.  
During the second year of my Master I worked as a research collaborator at the [Research Center of the Deutsche Bundesbank](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/research/research-centre) on a private project concerning the evaluation of publications in recent years. After that, I collaborated with the [Mannheim University of Applied Sciences](https://www.english.hs-mannheim.de/the-university.html) as an Erasmus student to take part to the research project about which I wrote my Master Thesis. These two experiences have increased my interest in the world of research. In fact, after my Master's degree (2021), I started working for the [WHO Collaborating Centre for Maternal & Child Health](https://apps.who.int/whocc/Detail.aspx?T28gvIaS0+uDrSKBCUN0vw==) Burlo Garofolo in Trieste as a research collaborator.  
After one year as a research collaborator, at the beginning of 2023, I became a Health Researcher. In October 2023, I obtained a [Second-level Short Specialisation degree in Machine learning and big data in precision medicine and biomedical research](https://uel.unipd.it/en/masters/ml-machine-learning-and-big-data-in-precision-medicine-and-biomedical-research/) from the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/). In November 2023 I started collaborating with the [Department of Genetics](https://www.burlo.trieste.it/laboratorio-genetica-medica) and the [Universitary Department of the Paediatric Clinic](https://www.burlo.trieste.it/clinica-pediatrica) at Burlo Garofolo and started in parallel a [PhD course in Artificial Intelligence and Applied Data Science](https://adsai.units.it/phd-program/) at the [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it/).
