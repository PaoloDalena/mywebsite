	abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic had an important psychological impact on children and their families. This study aims to explore paediatric health services users’ perceptions of quality of care (QOC) and COVID-19-related fears, and their evolution over time in relation to COVID-19 pandemic.Methods In a multicentre cross-sectional study involving 11 public hospitals providing paediatric care across the Italian territory, we collected data from services users through a validated questionnaire. We analysed four indicators—(1) QOC perceived in relation to COVID-19; (2) overall QOC perceived; (3) fear of accessing health services due to COVID-19; (4) fear of contracting COVID-19 in hospital—and calculated Spearman’s correlation indexes (ρ) with the number of COVID-19 new cases over time. Subgroup analyses were conducted by macroregions and single facility.Results Data from 956 services users were analysed. QOC indicators were stable over time at values close to the maximum (range 77–100 and median 100 for COVID-19 QOC, range 74–98 and median 80 for overall QOC), and no correlations were found with the COVID-19 new cases (ρ=−0.073 and −0.016, respectively). Fear of accessing care and fear of contracting the infection varied over time in between 0\%–52\% and 0\%–53\%, respectively, but did not correlate directly with number of COVID-19 new cases (ρ=0.101, 0.107 and 0.233, 0.046, respectively). At subgroup analyses, significantly higher frequencies of fear (p values {\textless}0.05) and lower QOC (p values {\textless}0.001) were reported in South Italy, and three facilities showed moderate correlation between these indicators.Conclusions COVID-19-related fears and perceived QOC may be mediated by more complex cultural and facility/regional-level factors, than simply by epidemic peaks. Subgroup analyses can help unpack major differences within the same country.},
