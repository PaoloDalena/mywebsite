abstract: "*Background:* The COVID-19 pandemic had an important psychological impact on children and their families. This study aims to explore paediatric health services users’ perceptions of quality of care (QOC) and COVID-19-related fears, and their evolution over time in relation to COVID-19 pandemic. *Methods:* In a multicentre cross-sectional study involving 11 public hospitals providing paediatric care across the Italian territory, we collected data from services users through a validated questionnaire. We analysed four indicators—(1) QOC perceived in relation to COVID-19; (2) overall QOC perceived; (3) fear of accessing health services due to COVID-19; (4) fear of contracting COVID-19 in hospital—and calculated Spearman’s correlation indexes (ρ) with the number of COVID-19 new cases over time. Subgroup analyses were conducted by macroregions and single facility. *Results:* Data from 956 services users were analysed. QOC indicators were stable over time at values close to the maximum (range 77–100 and median 100 for COVID-19 QOC, range 74–98 and median 80 for overall QOC), and no correlations were found with the COVID-19 new cases (ρ=−0.073 and −0.016, respectively). Fear of accessing care and fear of contracting the infection varied over time in between 0%–52% and 0%–53%, respectively, but did not correlate directly with number of COVID-19 new cases (ρ=0.101, 0.107 and 0.233, 0.046, respectively). At subgroup analyses, significantly higher frequencies of fear (p values <0.05) and lower QOC (p values <0.001) were reported in South Italy, and three facilities showed moderate correlation between these indicators. *Conclusions:* COVID-19-related fears and perceived QOC may be mediated by more complex cultural and facility/regional-level factors, than simply by epidemic peaks. Subgroup analyses can help unpack major differences within the same country."
