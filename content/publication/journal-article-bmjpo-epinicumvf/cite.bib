	abstract = {Background This study aimed at documenting the levels of stress, depression, anxiety and participation in care among mothers versus fathers of newborns hospitalised in a third-level neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Northern Italy.Methods Parental stress, depression and anxiety were assessed by the Parental Stressor Scale in NICU (PSS:NICU), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participation in care was evaluated with the Index of Parental Participation. Differences between mothers and fathers were assessed with the Mood{\textquoteright}s median test and z-test, respectively for continuous and discrete variables. Multivariate analyses controlling for potential confounders were performed to confirm gender differences.Results 191 parents (112 mothers and 79 fathers) were enrolled. Mothers reported significantly higher median scores for stress (2.9 vs 2.2, p\&lt;0.001) and trait anxiety (37 vs 32, p=0.004) and higher depression rates (EPDS >=12: 43.8\% vs 19.0\%, p\&lt;0.001). {\textquoteleft}High stress{\textquoteright} (PSS:NICU >=3) was reported by 45.5\% of mothers compared with 24.1\% of fathers (p=0.004). The frequency of the three conditions simultaneously was significantly higher among mothers (20.0\% vs 3.8\%, p=0.016), with the vast majority of mothers (76.0\%) suffering from at least one condition compared with less than half of fathers (45.3\%, p\&lt;0.001). Participation in care was more frequent in mothers (median score: 19 vs 15, p\&lt;0.001), with the exception of activities related to advocacy (median 5 vs 4, p=0.053). In a multivariate analysis, gender differences in mental health outcomes did not change.Conclusions Routine screening of mental distress among parents of infants in NICU is warranted, and gender differences need to be acknowledged in order to deliver tailored support and to promote collaboration with the family of vulnerable newborns. Knowledge and skills on how to prevent and cope with mental distress of parents should be part of the core curriculum of staff working in NICU.Data are available upon reasonable request.},
