abstract: ABSTRACT
Background Studies comparing the frequency of
different mental health conditions across different settings
and evaluating their association with parental participation
in newborn care are lacking. We aimed at evaluating the
frequency of parental stress, anxiety and depression, along
with the level of participation in newborn care, among
parents of newborns in Italy, Brazil and Tanzania.
Methods Parental stress, anxiety, depression and
participation in care were assessed prospectively in
parents of newborns in eight neonatal intensive care
units (NICUs) utilising: the Parental Stressor Scale in NICU
(PSS:NICU); the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
(EPDS) and EPDS-Anxiety subscale (EPDS-A); the Index of
Parental Participation in NICU (IPP-NICU). Univariate and
multivariate analyses were conducted.
Results Study outcomes were assessed on 742 parents
(Brazil=327, Italy=191, Tanzania=224). Observed scores
suggested a very high frequency of stress, anxiety and
depression, with an overall estimated frequency of any of
the mental health condition of 65.1%, 52.9% and 58.0%
in Brazil, Italy, Tanzania, respectively (p<0.001). EPDS
scores indicating depression (cut-off: ≥13 for Brazil and
Tanzania, ≥12 for Italy) were significantly more frequent
in Tanzania (52.3%) when compared with either Brazil
(35.8%) and Italy (33.3%) (p<0.001). Parental participation
in care was also significantly higher in Tanzania (median
IPP-NICU=24) than in the other two countries (median=21
for Brazil, 18 for Italy, p<0.001). Severe stress (PSS:NICU
≥4) was significantly more frequently reported in Brazil
(22.6%), compared with Italy (4.7%) and Tanzania (0%,
p<0.001). Factors independently associated with either
parental stress, anxiety or depression varied by country,
and a significant association with parental participation in
care was lacking.
Conclusions Study findings suggest that parental
stress, anxiety and depression are extremely frequent in
NICUs in all countries despite diversity in the setting, and
requiring immediate action. Further studies should explore
the appropriate level of parental participation in care in
different settings.
